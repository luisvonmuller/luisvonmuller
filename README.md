 - **Formal Education**: **Web Development Technical Course** at SENAI-SC, **Computer Engineering** at the **Federal University of Rio Grande** (FURG @ Brasil 🇧🇷) 
 *Dropped out on the third year because of Learning/Work oportunities (2019) that I decided that would be better for me 🥰 - In the future I hope to rejoin the Brazilian Academy 🇧🇷, or maybe rejoin the Academy out of Brazil?* 😊
 - **Informal or Online courses**: certifications will be **ASAP* on a public-repository **as well the notes taken on the courses**/snippets that I've saved. 👀 

**In short, I'm self-taught at the most of things**
